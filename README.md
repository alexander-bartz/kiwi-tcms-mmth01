# Kiwi TCMS - Steil-Plugin

This is the Git repository used as part of Alexander Bartz's master's thesis at the IU International University to publish the following extensions for Kiwi TCMS.
Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management tool for manual and automized testing but unfortunately has no import and export functionality embedded. 
Thus this plugin provides a resolving approach in contributing the following functionality.
For further information please visit the tool's website: https://kiwitcms.org/.

# Functionality
- Importer tool: Import a variety of sets of test artifacts and master data from a spreadsheet file.
  
- Quickstarter tool: Create a new ready-to-test test run from a test suite of an imported table file with test cases and specification of the test plan and test run information.
  
- Reporter tool: Report various customizable test and error statuses in the form of tabular evaluations or visualizations for a test run. Export the test results of a test run with the Kiwi TCMS Tester comments to a spreadsheet file.

# Installation Guide
For an installation guide please consult the following official Kiwi TCMS guide:

# Manual
There are manuals for each tool that can be opened at runtime. 

# Contribution & Usage
Feel free to contribute to this plugin as it still has some potential for improvement considering the better yet limited reporting capabilities of the customizable reporting dashboard.
